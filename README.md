## üì± Mobile

All of the apps listed here are open-source. Most of them are available on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/).
There are some exceptions, like X and Y for which you can only download the APK from the original website.
I have learnt about many of these apps from the [The ultimate F-Droid setup](https://alternativeto.net/lists/28655/the-ultimate-f-droid-setup/) blogpost which offers a wide collection of the best FLOSS apps out there. The page is really well put together and each app is in its own category.
